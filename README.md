# Tic Tac Toe

A simple project I made that enable's users to play tic tac toe. The project comes with a two player and single player mode.

In the single player mode the player will play against an AI(which use's the minimax algorithm)

I have uploaded the game to itch.io, the link to play is here https://cdiggli.itch.io/basic-tic-tac-toe
